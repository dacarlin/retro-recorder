*Have you ever forgotten to press the "Record" button, and you 
realize after you have played the song?*

The retro recorder is a digital "tape recorder"
that also happens to be able to time travel. 

As a result, it is possible to go back and hit record 
if you play something really cool but forgot to turn the 
recorder on. Up to 20 minutes.
